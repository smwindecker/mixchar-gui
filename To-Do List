mixchar-gui To-Do List

Hello, I'm Ryan, the original creator of this software package. This document lists unresolved work and optimization ideas so future contributors can pick them up quickly.

1. Fix the "Run Process" failure when using a new test set in the Shiny UI (error: "Processing failed. Please ensure the temperature units (C/K) match the file and the pyrolysis window is appropriate. The replacement data has 0 rows, but the dataset has 1544 rows.").
2. In step 2 ("Process data"), link the Temperature Program plot to the "Stage column (optional, for plotting)" selection.
3. With the example test set, the Temperature Program plot does not perfectly match the three-stage display in Stage summary; consider mapping the three stages to three distinct colors in the plot.
4. The fixed_carbon branch supports four peaks. After deconvolution there may be four values, but calculate_fixed_carbon_fractions() currently sums the two hemicellulose peaks. Update server.R to handle four peaks correctly and re-confirm the relevant line numbers.
5. Refine the name matching used when retrieving outputs from calculate_fixed_carbon_fractions() in server.R. The current approach is broad to avoid mixchar naming conflicts; improve it only after confirming function naming in the mixchar package.
6. Reduce duplicated code between the "dl_" download outputs and the corresponding main outputs; prefer shared helper functions so future changes stay in sync.
7. Improve the Sankey visualization in the "Carbon fractions" step (e.g., reposition the "Total Biomass (100%)" label so it is not tied to a single flow). The current version is a rough prototype.
8. Continue modularizing server functions: the Sankey code is already separated; similarly split other major nodes to simplify later edits or removal.
9. (Optional) For the "Pyrolysis phase deconvolution plot," add an option to plot selected carbon types individually.
10.In the GUI's visual interface, certain buttons, fields, and outputs may require more specialized descriptions. Consulting the developers of packages like mixchar may be necessary to obtain detailed descriptive information.
11. Clean up leftover, deprecated content in the mixchar package (e.g., the first-generation gui folder and unused functions).
12.All references to this Shiny (GUI) currently originate from the mixchar fixed-carbon branch. Once merged, please note changes to paths and comments.
